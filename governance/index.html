                    <h2>2. Operational Responsibility ("The Output Rule")</h2>

                    <h3>Non-Passivity Principle</h3>
                    <p>There is <strong>no such thing as a passive Senior Partner</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Each Senior Partner must act as a <strong>Department Head</strong> (e.g., Development, Building,
                        Art, Marketing, Operations).</p>

                    <h3>Mandate</h3>
                    <p>A Senior Partner is <strong>fully responsible</strong> for ensuring their department delivers
                        results on time and to scope.</p>

                    <h3>Execution vs. Delegation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Partner may execute tasks personally <strong>or</strong> delegate them.</li>
                        <li>Delegation <strong>does not remove responsibility</strong>.</li>
                        <li>If delegation requires funding, the Partner is expected to finance it from their own
                            resources or agreed departmental budget.</li>
                    </ul>

                        </ul>
